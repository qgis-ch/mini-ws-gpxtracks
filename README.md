# QGIS-CH Mini Workshop for visualizing GPS tracks and photos
In this mini workshop we will learn how to visualize GPS tracks logged by GPS application on a Smartphone or other GPS device.

## Prepare QGIS project
First we make sure that the new and empty QGIS project is set to the Swiss LV95 projection ("EPSG:2056"). You can quickly check it in the bottom right corner:

If that doesn't match the "EPSG:2056" just double click this button and a dialogue will open that allows you to change the projection accordingly.

Then we prepare our QGIS project by loading a few Swisstopo WMS layers as background layers. We add them into a layer group and set the the layer the visibility as "Mutually Exclusive" so that we can switch layer visibility with a single click, without having to turn off/on two layers subsequently.

You can download the [SwisstopoBackgroundLayerGroup.qlr](SwisstopoBackgroundLayerGroup.qlr) file and add it through drag and drop from the file manager to your new and empty project.
