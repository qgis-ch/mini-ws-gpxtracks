# QGIS-CH Mini Workshop for visualizing GPS tracks and photos
In this mini workshop we will learn how to visualize GPS tracks logged by GPS application on a Smartphone or other GPS device.

## Prepare QGIS project
First we prepare our QGIS project by loading a few Swisstopo WMS layers as background layers. We add them into a layer group and set the the layer the visibility as "Mutually Exclusive" so that we can switch layer visibility with a single click, without having to turn off/on two layers subsequently.

You can download the SwisstopLayers.qlr file and add it to your new and empty project.
